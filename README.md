##What you will be learning##
- [x] Prioritization 
- [x] Update UI in the background thread without freezing
- [x] Grand Dispatch Central 

###The Why###

If you don’t understand the reasoning for the above, you aren’t ready for this tutorial. I kindly ask you to leave now. If not, you’ve come to the right place.☝️...
